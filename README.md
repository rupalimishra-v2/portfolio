# Portfolio - Take it as a template, add your details editing it and you are good to go.

* The template is created using light weight framework i.e., Flask.

* The HTML, CSS, Js files have been taken from the web being not even novice in the frontend technologies.

* Download the requirements using the command : Run pip install -r requirements.txt (Python 2), or pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3).

* The app.py file renders the templates, and the form present in the website takes data dynamically and pushes it in a csv file that is stored in the same   directory as the project, you can fetch the details from the csv and get back to the people contacting.
